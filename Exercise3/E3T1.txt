# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

GuardDuty reports two Unauthorized Access:EC2/SSHBruteForce findings to us, in which 
* The first one stated that the EC2 instance was being used to perform the SSH Brute Force Attack, 
* While the other stated that the instance was attacked by SSH Brute Force attack.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
* Guard Duty would have discovered it by using the VPC Flow logs, which has detailed information about the traffic flow in the network.
* The VPC flow logs also show high number of requests being sent from one specific box which qualifies it for SSH Brute Force Attack. 
* Additionally, the IP address of the host performing the SSH Brute Force attack is also captured in the flows.
