Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

* IAM policy for the S3 bucket is not flowing the principle of least privilege, the entire access to the bucket is open
* Application running on port 5000 can be accessed via the internet, because that port is open for publically without restrictions
* Serverside encryption and logging is not enabled for S3 buckets which makes their content vulnerable if found
* EC2 instances management should be done via the Systems Manager


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) should be enabled for Root User
* Strict IAM Password policy should be set
* Disable all the non required port access from the EC2 instances, in other words, decrease the attack surface altogether
* Enable logging for S3 Buckets for accountability 
* Default Security Group can block all traffic, so that even if the developer has not specified the traffic rules, there is no accidental security violation
