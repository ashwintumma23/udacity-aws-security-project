* Do not allow SSH access from public internet to the EC2 instances
* Restrict network traffic from outside to reach only the application servers
* Update password policies to have strict rules to configure complex passwords, so that it is difficult to breach them

* Security Groups policy of the instances can be updated to only access the free recipes S3 bucket and in a read only configuration
* Server side encryption should be enabled on the bucket
