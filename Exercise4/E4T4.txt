# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
* Disable SSH access to the web application Ec2 instance and ensure the access is only via Systems Manager

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
* No, it will not prevent unauthorized access

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
* No, it will not encrypt existing files, they would have to be encrypted again

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
* All the security risks that we have identified in these exercises will come back to our environment, and make it insecure. So, whenever any changes are applied in an adhoc manner in the environment, should be propagated to the CloudFormation template immediately.
